    "Welcome to this Jupyter Notebook. A jupyter notebook is..\n",
    "> an **open-source web application** that allows you to create and share documents that contain **live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are often used in a scientific context because you can read it - just like now - from top to bottom and you can reproduce the results by a researcher because the researcher can include the source code and you can execute it on your own computer to check the results. Instead of trusting the results of a researcher, you can actually look at his/her methodology and check for mistakes or learn something new.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, we can add mix text and code - just like now - to explain the code we are writing or to give further context. During the lecture we will use Jupyter Notebooks to work with Python.\n",

If you plan to work as a Data Scientist, profound skills in Python are required.\n",

    "A notebook is composed of rectangular sections called **cells**. There are 2 kinds of cells: markdown and code. A markdown cell, such as this one, contains text. A code cell contains code in Python, a programming language that we will be using for the remainder of this module. You can select any cell by clicking it once. After a cell is selected, you can navigate the notebook using the up and down arrow keys.\n",

If a code cell is running, you will see an asterisk (*) appear in the square brackets to the left of the cell. Once the cell has finished running, a number will replace the asterisk and any output from the code will appear under the cell\n",
